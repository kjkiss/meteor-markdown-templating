It's useful to be able to make templates with Markdown and be able to use
helpers inside them! That's what the `markdown-templating` package lets you do.
If you want to replicate a certain Markdown style, make sure to include the
proper CSS. In this case, we have included CSS for a GitHub look, from
[sindresorhus/github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css/blob/gh-pages/github-markdown.css).
